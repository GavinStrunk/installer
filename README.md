# installer
for future reference during installations ; currently only Visual Python <br> 
Builds and installs wxPython, Polygon, TTFQuery, fonttools from source. <br>
fonttools can be installed as a wheel file now. So I replaced it with pip.<br>
tk, libgtk and boost-python are some other dependencies.
